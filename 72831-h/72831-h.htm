<p class="center muchlarger"><i>Left-over foods</i><br>
<i>and</i><br>
<i>how to use them</i></p>


<p class="drop-cap">I <span class="smcap">cannot</span> say that I altogether agree with the statement, “Scraps are
accidents to be taken care of, no doubt, but the very last objects on
which to bestow either expense or labor.” The “scraps” or “left-over”
bits of food that accumulate in the average household, <i>are</i> worthy of consideration
and with little labor and expense are convertible into the most palatable
viands. There is always some labor attendant on any and all household duties,
for we have all learned that the Earl of Chesterfield uttered a great truth
when he said (away back in the 17th century), “Whatever is worth doing at
all, is worth doing well.” I have discovered that this old maxim applies to
household management as well as all other vocations.</p>

<p>It is the careless tossing together of “left-over” food and giving the
creation when finished, a name quite as unattractive as itself, that has caused
this great antipathy so prevalent among people, for serving or partaking of
“made-up” dishes. <i>Hash</i>, itself, is a very much abused term as well as the
mixture thus named.</p>

<p>This little book of helpful suggestions has been carefully prepared and if
followed by the housewife, fortunate enough to receive one, she will find
immediate help over some of the “rough places” too often found in the daily
routine of house work, where the preparation for such duties has been limited.</p>

<p>Study the chapter on “How to Measure Accurately, and Combining
Ingredients,” and all the others and you cannot fail to learn, thoroughly,
the lesson “Left-Overs and How to Use Them.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>
To Market and Care for Food<br>
</h3>
</div>

<p>Every one seems to have “a way of their own” for marketing and taking
care of food. There are, however, but two methods of marketing and but one
<i>proper</i> way to take care of food.</p>

<p>One of the methods of marketing is that followed by the French and
Mexican housekeeper; that is, buying just enough for the daily needs and no
more. The other method is that in vogue in America and England. It is
buying provisions in large quantities (in some cases wholesale) flour, sugar
and apples by the barrel, butter by the firkin, canned goods by the case, sides
of bacon, whole hams, etc. Both methods have their advantages. The
one adopted by the prudent housewife will be that which best suits the
conditions under which she lives; the income, the size of the family, and the
conveniences provided for storing provisions.</p>

<p>Where the family is small and the home is an apartment, if it is equipped
with a fine large glass- or tile-lined McCray refrigerator, the problem of preserving
food is not difficult (see chapter on Care of Refrigerator, <a href="#care">page 10</a>).
For the small family, buying just what is needed for the day and no more is the
best. This method, does, however, require most careful thought, and very
accurate estimates must be made by the housewife, lest she buy more than
she can use and thereby sustain great waste.</p>

<p>Herein lies the necessity for housekeepers in general having a better
knowledge of food values. For the large family with a generous income, and
where cold storage provisions are made, buying in large quantities is by far
the most economical method to follow. Every housekeeper should do her own
marketing if possible; she thereby becomes acquainted with the market and
market prices, makes her selections, buying little or much as the case requires.
In this way she will soon learn the advantages gained by the French and
Mexican housekeepers’ methods. The latter carries her daily supplies home
in a receptacle made of a gourd holding less than a quart, while the former
does not hesitate to buy small portions of birds, fish, meats, etc. It is
obvious that the foreign methods show the greater economy.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>
A Word on Food in Season<br>
</h3>
</div>

<p>Food is at its best when in season. The price is at its minimum and the
flavor and quality all that can be desired.</p>

<p>Out of season, all food becomes a luxury and is lacking in flavor as well
as quality. The provident housekeeper will take advantage through the year,
of fruits and vegetables, when seasonable, beginning in the early spring to
put away her stores for the following winter. To these she may add dried
and canned fruits that have proved by use to be most wholesome and palatable.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">


<div class="chapter">

<h3>
Care of Vegetables, Fresh Fruit, etc.<br>
</h3>
</div>

<p>Fresh vegetables should be cooked as soon as possible after being taken
from the garden. Where it is necessary to keep them, all wilted leaves and
unsightly portions should be removed and vegetables spread out in a cool,
well ventilated place. If placed in the refrigerator, first prepare them for
cooking, then fold them in cheese cloth, wrung from fresh cold water, and
place them on the top shelf of the refrigerator. The leaves of such vegetables
as lettuce, endive, cress, dandelions, etc. may be kept fresh and crisp. After
picking them over wash and drain, put them in a covered lard pail, and
place in the refrigerator. Wilted vegetables may be restored by soaking in
fresh cold water. Cucumbers may be pared and thinly sliced, placed in a
fruit jar, closely covered, and kept crisp and fresh in the refrigerator for
several days.</p>


<h4>
Fresh Fruit<br>
</h4>

<p>All fruits may be kept in fine condition where the luxury of a large cold
storage room is installed. Where a refrigerator is used, great care should be
exercised in placing fruits and vegetables in their respective places. (See
frontispiece, <a href="#frontis">page 2</a>).</p>

<p>There are some fruits, owing to their strong odor, that should never be
placed in the refrigerator; these include, bananas, musk-melons, canteloupe,
etc. Other food will soon become flavored from contact with such fruits when
confined in the refrigerator or even in a store-room. Milk, cream, butter and
other fats most readily absorb flavors when exposed to odorous fruits, flowers,
etc. The greatest care should be given the left-over food. It should be put
in small vessels (jelly glasses) with closely fitting covers, then placed in the
refrigerator; there will then be little danger of contamination.</p>

<p>Over ripe vegetables (especially tomatoes) and fruits should not be kept
in the refrigerator. Berries should be carefully picked over, and washed,
when necessary, before putting them in the refrigerator. Strawberries may
be picked over, placed in a colander or a croquette basket and cold water
poured over them before removing the hulls.</p>


<h4>
Potatoes<br>
</h4>

<p>Potatoes keep better and are lower in price before they have been stored.
It is therefore economy for the large consumer to buy them, early in the
season, when they are most plentiful. They may be kept in barrels or bins,
raised three inches from the floor, in a cool dry room or cellar. For the small
family, where space is a consideration, it is more economical to buy not less
than a peck at a time. They may be kept in a box lined with heavy paper
in a cool dry place.</p>


<h4>
Sweet Potatoes<br>
</h4>

<p>Sweet potatoes are in season from August to May, and should be bought
in small quantities. The kiln-dried sweet potatoes are the best. These fleshy
roots of plants belong to a different family from the white potato, they
contain a large percentage of sugar and have not the keeping qualities of the
white potato. They, too, should be kept in a cool dry place.</p>


<h4>
Beef and Mutton<br>
</h4>

<p>A loin of beef or a side of mutton is a profitable investment for the large
consumer. With proper cold storage facilities the meat can be kept well and
is much improved by “hanging.”</p>


<h4>
Fish<br>
</h4>

<p>Fresh fish should be dressed at the market and removed from the paper
as soon as delivered. Salt should never be sprinkled over fish “to keep it.”
The salt extracts the rich juices and leaves the fish tasteless. Simply cover
it closely and put it in a cold place. If securely covered it may be placed,
with safety, in the refrigerator.</p>


<h4>
Butter<br>
</h4>

<p>Butter should be placed in the refrigerator as directed above, namely:
under the ice chamber which is the coldest part of the refrigerator; this space
should be reserved for the butter, cream, milk, eggs and meat.</p>

<p>Butter should always be closely covered. An earthen jar, with a close
fitting cover, may be purchased at any house furnishing shop for ten cents;
this size will hold five pounds and will prove very satisfactory.</p>


<h4>
Milk and Cream<br>
</h4>

<p>Too much care and attention cannot be given to this food; even though
it does not sour as quickly in winter as it does in hot weather, it should have
just the same care. Never allow either cream or milk to stand uncovered.
There is nothing gained by paying a fancy price for milk which has been
pasteurized and kept clean, under the most sanitary conditions in the dairy,
before delivery to the consumer, if the latter does not know how to take care
of it and leaves it uncovered, in a hot kitchen or in a refrigerator, with other
uncovered food. There need be no surprise if it sours quickly and develops
an unpleasant flavor; for both milk and butter will absorb odors and flavors
when thus exposed, which will render them unfit for use. Make it <i>an
invariable</i> rule, <i>never</i> to allow these foods to remain uncovered.</p>


<h4>
Eggs<br>
</h4>

<p>Wash the eggs, when they come from the market, in cold water. The
shells are then clean and ready for use. They are used for clearing soup
stock, coffee, etc. Eggs, too, should be kept in the coldest part of the
refrigerator along with milk, cream and butter.</p>

How to Measure Accurately<br>

 <p class="caption smaller">MEASURING CUP MARKED IN THIRDS</p>
</div><!--end figright-->

<p>A system of accurate measurements is absolutely
necessary to insure success. Scientific
training has exploded the old idea, that “with
good judgment and experience measuring ingredients
<i>by sight</i> will do.” The exact quantity called
for, measured each time in the same utensil
whatever it be, cup, tablespoon or teaspoon are
definite guides that must be followed if success
would be attained. Enameled measuring
cups marked plainly
in quarters or thirds
each holding a half-pint,
a teaspoon holding sixty drops, a tablespoon
of ordinary size (do not mistake a dessert spoon
for this spoon) and a case-knife are the few
essentials that must be used for measuring
ingredients in the recipes incorporated in this
book. These utensils may be purchased at any
kitchen-furnishing shop for a nominal sum.</p>


<h4>
To Measure Ingredients<br>
</h4>

<p>All flour, meal, confectioners’, powdered and granulated sugar, soda and
other dry ingredients, that are put into cartons or cans, that are apt to settle
and in some cases harden, should be sifted before measuring. This suggestion
is not to be ignored if you would be successful as well as economical, for by
sifting these ingredients they are lightened and made to go further.</p>


<h4>
A Cupful<br>
</h4>

<p>A cupful means all the cup will hold; the cup is filled with a tablespoon
heaping full, then leveled with a knife. Great care must be taken not to
shake the cup. All dry ingredients are tossed lightly into the cup, then
leveled with a knife.</p>


<h4>
Measuring Liquids<br>
</h4>

<p>Place the cup to be filled on a saucer, and fill it to the brim. A cupful
of liquid could not be carried safely across the kitchen without spilling some
of its contents.</p>


<h4>
Measuring Butter, Lard, Etc.<br>
</h4>

<p>Fats used for shortening are packed solidly in cups, table or teaspoon
and leveled with a knife. A pair of measuring cups will be found very convenient
when measuring ingredients. One for the dry and the other for the
shortening and liquids. One cup may serve the purpose if dry ingredients
are measured first, then liquids and fats when such ingredients are called for.</p>


<h4>

Tablespoons and Teaspoons<br>
</h4>

<p>Tablespoons of regulation size are filled and leveled with a knife. A
teaspoon is filled and leveled with a knife. To measure liquids, a table or
teaspoon means all the spoon will hold.
To measure dry ingredients in table or
teaspoon, dip the spoon in the ingredient.
When filled, lift, and level with
knife, sharp edge of blade turned toward handle of spoon. Dividing with
knife lengthwise of the bowl of spoon is a half-teaspoonful. Dividing the half
crosswise is a fourth, and dividing the fourth crosswise is one-eighth. Divisions
are made in the teaspoon the same. Less than an eighth of a teaspoon
is a few grains.</p>

</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<h4>
Combining Ingredients<br>
</h4>

<p>The next very important step toward success in all cookery, is in combining
ingredients and mixtures; and one too often disregarded by the
amateur. There are three movements considered in combining ingredients—stirring,
beating, and cutting and folding.</p>

<p><i>Stirring</i> is combining ingredients by circular motions, enlarging and
repeating these motions until all ingredients are thoroughly blended. This
motion is most commonly used in all cookery, either alone or alternating with
beating.</p>

<p><i>Beating</i> is accomplished by cutting down through ingredient or ingredients
with a mixing spoon, or a similar utensil, from top to bottom, turning ingredients
over and over, cutting through them until all are thoroughly blended
and lightened. By this motion ingredients are not only blended, but air, also,
is incorporated which increases the lightness of the mixture.</p>

<p><i>Cutting and Folding</i> means to combine two mixtures, one made very light
by thorough beating or whipping, as heavy cream or whites of eggs. This
is a combination of the two former motions. It is best accomplished with a
wooden spoon made for this purpose. These repeated vertical downward
motions, made with this spoon, is called cutting, and turning the ingredients
over and over, allowing the spoon with each turn to come in contact with the
bottom of the bowl is called folding. Repeat these motions until the
ingredients are thoroughly blended without destroying the air bubbles previously
made by beating or whipping one part of the mixture. Briefly—</p>

<p><i>To stir</i> means blending ingredients.</p>

<p><i>To beat</i> means lightening the mixture by incorporating air.</p>

<p><i>To cut and fold</i> is combining two mixtures (one of which has been made
light by beating) in such a manner as to prevent the escape or loss of air
previously introduced.</p>

<h3>
The Refrigerator<br>
</h3>
</div>


<p>For the preservation of food before cooking, and for the left-overs after
a meal, there is no appliance placed in the home that is of so much
importance as the refrigerator. It should be a McCray Refrigerator, a
perfectly beautiful, practical, convenient and entirely sanitary accession
to the needs of the kitchen, the chief <i>essential</i> of its furnishings.
It should be large and well adapted to the wants and necessities of
the household, with an ice capacity of at least one hundred pounds. It
is the best made refrigerator, offered for sale and for the consumers
comfort, in the world to-day. When planning your kitchen, be sure you
have a place, well-selected, for one of these refrigerators. Its drain
pipes should never be connected directly with the sewer, and if possible
locate it so that the ice compartment may be reached from the outside
from a rear porch—that is opening out of doors. This will save much
annoyance from the iceman, with soiled shoes, trailing dripping ice across
the clean kitchen floor. The refrigerator should be easy of access for
the cook, for plain as well as fancy cooking, demands many steps. Much
time and energy is saved by a little judicious planning in locating the
kitchen appliances. Remember the old adage, “Let your head save your
heels.”</p>


<h4><a id="care"></a>
Care of the Refrigerator<br>
</h4>

 alt="Title or description">
 <p class="caption xxs">BRUSH FOR<br>
REFRIGERATOR<br>
DRAIN PIPE</p>
</div><!--end figleft-->

<p>In giving the proper attention to the care of the refrigerator, there
are three very essential points to observe; the first, and most important,
the location of the refrigerator, then the waste pipe, and last but not least
a full supply of ice. If economy is an item in the management of the
house, then special attention will be given the place in which refrigerator is
placed—a cool, dry, well ventilated room, conveniently near the kitchen
that steps may be saved and where the direct rays of the sun <i>do not
fall on it</i>, and where the iceman can gain access to it without “tracking
up” the kitchen with his soiled shoes.</p>

<p>The compartments in which the food is kept should be wiped out
carefully once a week. If anything is spilled within the refrigerator it
should be removed immediately. All crumbs, drops of liquid or small
particles of food should be carefully and instantly removed.</p>

<p>Once a week the supply of ice may be allowed to run low; the ice
may then be removed and the ice chamber thoroughly washed, the rack
upon which the ice stands washed and rinsed with a solution of sal soda,
the drain pipe and the trap also thoroughly swabbed out with a brush
attached to a long wire handle, made for this purpose. Pour the solution
through the drain pipe as far as it can be reached and then rinse with
clear boiling water.</p>

<p>The ice compartment should be kept filled with ice. A large piece of
ice keeps better than a small one and insures much better circulation
of air. The door to the ice compartment should be kept tightly closed
at all times save when it is being filled with ice. The fact is that all the
doors should be opened and closed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>
The most scrupulous cleanliness in all its parts should be found in the
refrigerator. Food such as meat, potatoes, etc. should never be laid on the
shelves of the refrigerator, and the habit of filling the ice chamber with meat,
fish, fowl and vegetables is most unsanitary and unhealthful.</p>


<h4>
The Care of Food in the Refrigerator<br>
</h4>

<p>When the food is placed on the table in the kitchen by the tradesman,
the care of it at once falls upon the one who is in charge of the household
and she must know just how to take care of each article.</p>

<p>All meat should be removed from the paper at once; wiped with a piece
of cheese cloth wrung from cold water, placed on a plate, another plate turned
over it and placed in the position indicated, <a href="#frontis">in frontispiece</a>, on page 2. The
butter should be put in a jar, covered and placed on the shelf of the refrigerator
immediately under the ice chamber. A space should be left on this shelf
for eggs, milk and cream. Cheese should be removed from the manilla paper
leaving it wrapped in the wax paper, and placed in a covered vessel in the
refrigerator. The care of vegetables, fruits, meats, fish, etc., follows
hereinafter.</p>

<li>Few grains pepper.</li>
<li>4 tablespoons hot water.</li>
<li>1½ tablespoons butter.</li>
<li>2 tablespoons finely minced ham.</li>
<li>1½ cups thin White Sauce.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="smcap">Process</span>: Beat the yolks thick and light, add seasoning. Beat the whites
stiff. Add hot water to yolks of eggs and heat again, add minced ham; cut and
fold the whites into the first mixture until they are well blended. Heat the omelet
pan, have bottom and sides well buttered. Turn in the mixture and spread
smoothly, place on range with asbestos cover placed over flame; let cook slowly,
turning the pan occasionally, that omelet may brown evenly. When omelet is
“puffed” to top of pan and delicately browned on the bottom, place pan in oven
on middle grate to finish cooking on top. The omelet is cooked, if it is dry, a
straw color and will not cling to the finger when lightly pressed. Fold and turn
on a hot serving platter, surround with thin White Sauce. Minced Chicken,
Turkey and Veal may be used alone or in combination in place of Ham.</p>


<h4>
Ham with Currant Jelly<br>
</h4>

<p>Melt one tablespoon butter in a sauce-pan; add one-half cup currant jelly;
when jelly is melted add a few grains cayenne or one eighth teaspoon paprika;
add four tablespoons sherry wine, and a cup and one-half cold cooked ham
cut in thin small slices or strips, simmer gently until ham is heated.</p>


<h4>

<li>¼ cup butter.</li>
<li>1 tablespoon pimentoes.</li>
<li>1 tablespoon Chutney.</li>
<li>½ teaspoon curry powder.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Few drops Tobasco.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="smcap">Process</span>: Put ham, chicken and pimentoes through the meat chopper;
then pound mixture thoroughly in a mortar or chopping bowl. Rub through
a sieve and add seasonings. Spread on circles or tri-angles of bread fried
and cooled, decorate with the white of egg finely chopped, the yolk passed
through a sieve—first laying two thin strips of pimento crossing each at right
angles. Fill two opposite spaces with the whites of eggs and two with the
yolks. Garnish with sprays parsley.</p>


<h4>
Scrambled Eggs with Minced Ham and Chicken<br>
</h4>


<ul><li>4 eggs slightly beaten.</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt.</li>

<li>4 tablespoons milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoon finely minced ham.</li>
<li>1 tablespoon finely minced chicken.</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="smcap">Process</span>: Beat eggs slightly, add seasoning and milk; add chicken and
ham well mixed. Melt butter in omelet pan; pour in mixture and cook until
of a creamy consistency; stirring constantly and scraping mixture from
bottom and sides of pan. Roll to one side of pan and turn on hot platter,
sprinkle with paprika. Garnish with parsley.</p>


<h4>
How to Keep Left-Over Whites and Yolks of Eggs<br>
</h4>

<p>In recipes where only the whites of eggs are used, “left-over” yolks
may be kept by beating them well, then turn them into a jelly glass, cover
and place them in the refrigerator. Or, as they are broken from the shells
and are whole, they may be slipped carefully into hot water, just below the
boiling point, and allow to cook through. Then one may be served in each
portion of clear soup. They may also be pressed through the potato ricer as
a garnish over the salad, over Creamed Cod Fish or Creamed Toast. (Covering
the yolks with cold water as a means of keeping them has not proven
satisfactory). If the yolks only are used the whites will keep several days if
turned into a bowl or jelly glass, covered, and placed in the refrigerator.</p>

Left-Over Potatoes and Vegetables<br>
</h3>
</div>


<h4>
Potato Cakes<br>
</h4>

<p>Beat two cups of left-over mashed potatoes with a very little hot milk to
lighten them. Season with a few drops onion juice, salt, pepper, one-half
teaspoon parsley finely chopped, and one-fourth cup grated cheese and a few
grains cayenne. Shape in small round flat cakes, dip in flour and saute in hot
butter (about two tablespoons), brown on one side, turn and brown on the
other. This mixture may be packed in a brick-shape mold, then turned on
a board and sliced, dipped in flour and sauted in butter as the round cakes.</p>


<h4>
Creamed Potatoes<br>
</h4>

<p>Cut cold boiled or baked potatoes in one-fourth inch cubes (there should
be two cups), sprinkle with salt, pepper, and one half teaspoon finely chopped
parsley; add a few drops onion juice if desired. Re-heat in one and one-half

iron spider; when hot, add one sliced onion, cook until onion is delicately
browned; remove onion and keep warm, add potatoes, season with salt and
pepper, mix thoroughly with fat, shaking the spider occasionally when potatoes
are browned, add onion; when thoroughly mixed and heated, turn into hot
dish and serve at once.</p>


<h4>
Potatoes Delmonico<br>
</h4>

<p>Arrange creamed potatoes in layer, in a buttered baking dish, adding a
sprinkle of grated cheese to each layer, a slight sprinkle of salt and paprika
or a few grains cayenne. There should be plenty of Cream Sauce mixed with
the potatoes. Cover with buttered crumbs and bake in a hot oven until mixture
is heated throughout and crumbs are brown.</p>


<h4>
Stuffed Peppers<br>
</h4>

one-eighth teaspoon celery salt, a few grains pepper, add six tablespoons
milk and one egg lightly beaten.</p>


<h4>
Creamed Celery With Cheese<br>
</h4>

<p>Wash, scrape and cut the outer stalks of celery into three-fourth inch
pieces; cook in boiling salted water to cover until tender. Drain. (There
should be two and one-half cups). Add one and one-half cups thin White
Sauce to which add one-fourth cup grated cheese and a few grains cayenne.</p>


<h4>
Corn Oysters<br>
</h4>

<p>Grate the left-over boiled corn from the cob (there should be one cup
of pulp). Add one lightly beaten egg, four and one-half tablespoons flour,
season well with salt, pepper and one teaspoon sugar. Drop by spoonfuls on
a hot well greased griddle and cook as griddle cakes. They should be the

stamp out centre, being careful not to
cut through. The wall of boxes should
be one-third inch thick. Place boxes
on a plate and baste them with egg
diluted with cold milk, using two
tablespoons milk to each egg. Season egg with salt, and when each box is
well-soaked, drain, lift carefully with a spatula, place in a croquette basket
and fry in deep, hot fat. Drain on brown paper and fill with creamed
chicken, sweetbreads, mushrooms, brains, etc.</p>

 <p class="caption">Coffee Jelly</p>
</div><!--end figright-->

<p><span class="smcap">Process</span>: Soak gelatin thirty
minutes in cold water, dissolve in
boiling water, strain through sieve,
add to sugar and coffee, add vanilla.
Turn into a ring mold and chill.
Unmold on a cold glass platter and

<br>


<h4>
Candied Orange Peel<br>
</h4>

<p>Save the left-over peel from four large thinned-skin oranges cut in
quarters or halves. Cover with cold salted water, let stand over night. In
the morning drain and rinse thoroughly. Put peel in a sauce-pan and cover
with cold water, bring to boiling point, let boil five minutes, pour off water
and cover with fresh boiling water; repeat three times. Then add boiling
water and let cook until tender. Drain and remove the white portion, using
a teaspoon. Cut peel in narrow shreds, using the shears. Prepare a syrup
of two cups sugar and one-half cup water, skim syrup if necessary, and let
cook until it spins a thread when dropped from the tip of a wooden spoon.
Simmer shreds of orange peel in syrup until they have absorbed nearly all
the syrup; then boil rapidly, stirring until each shread is well coated with
sugar. Drain and coat with fine granulated sugar. Let dry in a warm oven.
Then store in tin left over crystalized ginger or marshmallow boxes.</p>

<h3>
In Conclusion—Let Nothing Be Wasted<br>
</h3>
</div>


<p>That small piece of ham left from breakfast, finely minced, will doubtless
make one tablespoonful, when finely minced, for your omelet.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The half-cup of creamed onions left from dinner, if rubbed through
a sieve, added to thin white sauce and served with “hard boiled” eggs, will
furnish a delicious dish for luncheon or supper.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The small bits of jelly added to a berry pie will materially improve the
richness of its juice, or it may be added to the mince meat, but should never
be thrown away. The tablespoonful of apple and other sauces left-over may
be used in a similar way.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The leaves and roots of celery, as well as the outer stocks, may all be used
either for making cream of celery soup or for flavoring the soup stock.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Broken crackers that cannot be served on the table, may be crushed
moderately and used for stuffing, or may be rolled fine and used for crumbing
oysters, scallops or fish, croquettes, etc.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There need be no waste of stale bread in the kitchen. For stale bread
can be used in an infinite variety of ways. Only the thin brown crust may
be removed and this makes good food for the chickens. Smalls bits of bread
should be dried in the warming oven, covered with a piece of cheese cloth to
protect it from dust, then passed through the meat chopper and sifted. The
fine crumbs are used for crumbing purposes, and the coarse crumbs for the
top of Au Gratin dishes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The onion from which a slice has been cut, should be turned “cut side”
down on a saucer, and covered with a cup or small bowl, and set aside in a
cool place for future use.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When using garlic, break off one section, called “a clove of garlic,”
in cooking parlance. The remainder of bulb will keep some time if kept dry.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The outer leaves of lettuce, if not wilted and torn, may be cut in shreds
or ribbons and used to garnish salad or cold meat dishes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Stale cheese has many possibilities, as shown in the chapter on “How to
Use Stale Cheese.” If kept in a cool place, in a covered dish, it may be
grated and ready for future use.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The stale rye bread makes delicious stuffing, and is also used for making
puddings.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Brown bread may be dried, then crumbed and used in ice cream or
bisque, and will take the place of macaroons very palatably.</p>
